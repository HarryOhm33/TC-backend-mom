### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Render Free Tier

Render provides **750 hours of free-tier uptime per month**, which equals **31 days** of continuous usage. However, if you're running **multiple services** under the same account, the hours get split. To maximize uptime, consider using **separate Render accounts** for different services.
